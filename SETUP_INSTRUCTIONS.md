# 🚀 Bharat Minds - Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in the details:**
   - Repository name: `bharat-minds`
   - Description: `A modern AI chat interface with Indian-inspired design`
   - Make it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** check "Choose a license" (we already have one)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Run the Setup Script

Once you've created the repository, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
./setup-repo.sh YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

**Example:**
```bash
./setup-repo.sh sahibsingh13
```

## Step 3: Verify the Push

The script will:
- ✅ Add your new repository as the remote origin

If you get a permission error:
